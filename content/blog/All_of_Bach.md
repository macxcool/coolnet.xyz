The [Netherlands Bach Society](https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en) has been working on the ambitious project to record all of Johann Sebastian Bach's works in high quality video made freely available to the whole world via the Internet. They call this project [All of Bach](https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/about-allofbach).

Here is their latest offering and it's nothing short of beautiful.
