Wim Winters has uploaded a very interesting video where he cites a conversation Franz Liszt had with a detractor at a dinner party. Liszt explains and demonstrates three types of musical interpretations of a piece by Bach.

Winters also talks about some of the criticisms that have been levelled at him and explains that he is just trying to figure out what the composers' intentions were, not trying to tell anyone how to perform.
