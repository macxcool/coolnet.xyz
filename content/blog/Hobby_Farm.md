I spent 15 years of my adult life on a farm. It wasn't a large farm, by any means, but it was a farm nonetheless. The property was about $ 2\frac{1}{2} $ acres and it had a hundred year old house, a big red cattle barn, a small wood lot and a lot of grass.

This was the place our family moved into when we moved to the London area. We only had Isaac then, and Carole, Nicole's mom bought the property with us and lived with us.
