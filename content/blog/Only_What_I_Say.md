I've entered a 90-day Bible reading challenge. It's amazing how much time I spend every day thinking about the Bible right now. I've never done anything like this before. Unfortunately part of that is thinking about how far I'm falling behind in my goals, but...



The thing is, until my family was introducted to [Jamie Soles](https://solmusic.ca) the only time I had music in my head when reading scripture was when I read passages that make up part of the libretto of Handel's Messiah. But now, as I read through Numbers 23 I hear the sounds of [''*Dust of Jacob*''](https://solmusic.ca/music/funandprophets/). His songs will be with me and my family for the rest of our lives, and we're thankful.
