## This is my first attempt

This is my first attempt at a Hugo site using the Codex theme. I've decided to use Namecheap for my domain registrar and Netlify for hosting. It doesn't get much better than this.

## A little bit about me

I'm a servant of Jesus of Nazareth, husband of Nicole and father of two men, Isaac and Phillip. I work in IT for a large school board, mostly scripting in PowerShell.

## Some of my favourite things

- God's word, the Bible
- Reading about theology and philosophy
- Reading fantasy fiction
- Music
  - I play the violin, recorder, mandolin and I sing
  - I love all kinds of music, as long as it is musically interesting, skillfully done and doesn't have offensive elements
- Linux and open source
  - I've been playing with Linux for many years
  - I run Archlinux on my systems when possible but use Debian for my ODroid XU4-based NAS (OpenMediaVault) and the Raspberry Pi OS for our family's Minecraft server ([using Paper](https://papermc.io)) on a Raspberry Pi 4
  - I enjoy finding ways to do things with open source software that are normally done using commercial products
- Math, Science and Coding
  - I tutor highschool Math, I love Science since it's our way of thinking God's thoughts after him and, even though I'm not a software developer, I dabble in PowerShell, shell scripting, Python and anything else I can get my hands on.
